1.0 Functionality
    1.1 Fingers
        •	Use stronger elastic, the thin strands I used have a tendency to break
        •	Wider hole for the elastic to be fed thru
        •	Not all the black finger pieces fit snuggly on the white ones, this prevents smooth rotation of the fingers and   
            consequently sometimes the tension in the elastic isn’t enough to pull them back to rest and they get stuck.
        •	Potentiometers in the knuckle are ineffective as the top segment of the finger (where the finger nail would be)  
            tends to bend first, followed by the second, meaning no reading is collected until the segment closest to the palm  
            starts rotating. Thus if something blocks the segment closest to the palm, you have no knowledge of the position  
            of the top two segments, they will begin rotating why the potentiometer reads the finger is at rest, fully extended.  
            To overcome this you could design a way to have IMU's in the different segments of the finger, or potentiometers in  
            each of the points of rotation (both of which I don't see as being practical, given the space restraints and the  
            number of wires required to fit) or a motor encoder to track how many revolutions the motor makes.
        •	Ideally I would actuate the pinky and ring fingers separately, but not of vital importance since you rarely need  
            to move one without moving the other one.
        •	Tying knot in end of elastic is almost impossible while keeping it taught, had to set for super glue instead. 
    1.2 Thumb
        •	Axle it spins on is too loose, fortunately this would be a pretty simple fix 
        •	When the finger is contracted, the finger begins to rotate as well as being contracted because the axle mount on  
            the thumb rotation servo is too loose, the simple fix would be using a bit of epoxy or superglue.
        •	The thumb contraction has no postition feedback, this is perhaps the most serious issue with this design as it can  
            only be controlled by sight or else it will over contract, breaking either the servo or the thumb. Solutions to  
            this could involve; some sort of mount for a potnetiometer in the thumb to read the position, use of a reference 
            IMU or perhaps a redesign of how the servos controlling the hand such as using a motor encoder to track rotations.
        •	Some of the issues of the fingers mentioned above in 1.1, translate also into the thumb
    1.3 Servos 
        ¬Continuous Rotation servos (Index and Thumb Contraction)
            •	Biggest issue is lose of rotation issue as discussed above, better to use small, geared motors with a motor  
                encoder.
            •	Occassionally the fishing line can slip off the pulleys, especially if the fishing line is not under constant  
                tension 
            •	Because the fishing line can wrap around the pulley in both directions, if you are trying to relax the finger  
                by unwinding the pulley and the finger gets stuck (as mentioned above in section 1.1 due to coarse joints) the  
                pulley can keep rotating to the point the fishing line starts wrapping around the pulley in the opposite  
                direction, resulting in the finger being contracted without ever fully relaxing (since the pots only measure 
                knuckle rotation and have no info on the top two segments)
        ¬Compressed 2-in-1 continuous rotation geared dc motors
            •	For the most part this design worked extremely well (since it is "technically" the same as a normal servo, see  
                comments in instructable link for explanation) the biggest issue was my, axle substitute is too narrow,  
                resulting in large vibrations in the gears, later damaging the plastic teeth of the gears actuating the  
                pinky/ring finger combination. Had I found an axle of perfect diameter I believe this would be a null issue.
        ¬Thumb rotation servo
            •	All in all aside from the slipping issue mentioned under section 1.2 this operated as expected.
    1.4 Palm
        •	Thumb contraction servo is free to move, no enough support walls to hold it in place, instead had to use glue, 
            something I would prefer not to use, in order to replace parts easily
        •	Ideally I would place an additional screw hole near the pinky finge
        •	Serveral of the finger contraction pulleys are too close to the wall, resulting in significant friction, but 
            mostly a simple fix 
        •	The fishing line holes for fingers are hard to clean without a long drill bit
        •	Hard to service/ take apart if any of the servos break/ fishing line gets twisted.
        •	Ideally make more space for new sensors and additional wiring inside palm
    1.5 Wrist
        •	The servos are too weak to actually rotate the wrist (at least for the springs I used), so while it looks pretty, the wrist doesn't actually do anything
        •	While the wrist functions well (I tested it with higher torque servos) it probably won’t work well and may break (depending on the spring and servo strength) if the hand is holding anything of significant weight.
        •	Of the 4 screw holes used for mounting the servos in the forearm only 1 can be reached with a screwdriver (oversight on my part), instead I had to use glue
        •	The servo responsible for left/right motion (ie waving) could easily be torn out of its mount, instead I should have put a wall on the other side of the servo to prevent it from pulling itself out under its own rotation.
    1.6 Forearm
        •	The forearm should be made wider so larger, high torque servos such as Kuman MG996 can fit inside without the armatures hitting the walls.
        •	Redesigned so the hand can rotate around the forearm axis (ie similar to how the human forearm can roll around its own axis) while the base of the forearm near the elbow remains stationary.
        •	The black piece of the forearm needs to have its edges trimmed for a smoother fit inside the white pieces
    1.7 3D printing issues and CAD file issues
        •	Nothing too major, mostly that cleaning out support structures can be a challenge in some hard to reach areas
        •	As with all projects this large, there is a long printing time, thus the tradeoff between layer height and time must be considered

2.0 Aesthetics 
    •	The section where the knuckles meet the palm needs to be smoothed out
    •	Not a huge issue but the hand is slightly larger than an adult males hand, in later versions I would like to shrink it
    •	The knuckles of a normal human hand arch [1] with the middle knuckle being at the peak of the arch, whereas mine is an (almost) linear progression from pinky being the lowest knuckle to the highest knuckle being the index
    •	Perhaps some covers to hide the screws in the palm
